# AI-Spam-Email-Detector

A comprehensive project to classify emails as **spam** or **ham (non-spam)** using deep learning. This repository provides an end-to-end solution for detecting spam emails with high accuracy while ensuring a balanced and unbiased approach.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Accurate Classification:** Achieved **97%+ validation accuracy** on unseen data.
- **Balanced Dataset:** Applied downsampling techniques to ensure fairness in classification.
- **Scalable Model:** Designed with modern neural network architecture suitable for text classification.

---

## üìö Overview

Spam emails clutter inboxes and pose security risks. This project aims to create a robust spam detection system that:

1. **Enhances Inbox Experience:** Reduces junk emails while retaining important communications.
2. **Improves Security:** Detects harmful or malicious content effectively.
3. **Leverages AI:** Implements deep learning for efficient and scalable email filtering.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- **Tokenization:** Converts text into numerical sequences for machine learning.
- **Padding/Truncation:** Standardizes input lengths for consistent processing.
- **Balancing:** Downsamples the majority class (ham) to ensure equal representation of spam and ham emails.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
- **Embedding Layer:** Transforms text tokens into dense semantic vectors.
- **Global Average Pooling:** Summarizes email content into a compact representation.
- **Dense Layers:** Processes and classifies data using ReLU and sigmoid activation functions.
- **Dropout Regularization:** Prevents overfitting and improves generalization.

### 3. **Training**
- Trained for **up to 30 epochs** with **early stopping** to avoid overfitting.
- Optimized using **binary cross-entropy loss** and tracked with accuracy metrics.

## üí° Results

- **Validation Accuracy:** Exceeded **97%**, proving effective generalization.
- **Balanced Classification:** Prevented bias towards the majority class by equalizing data distribution.
- **Robust Design:** Achieved reliable results without overfitting through regularization and early stopping.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Preprocessing:** Incorporate lemmatization, stemming, or pretrained embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).
2. **Architectural Improvements:** Explore RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, or transformers for richer text understanding.
3. **Expanded Metrics:** Use precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for a comprehensive performance evaluation.
